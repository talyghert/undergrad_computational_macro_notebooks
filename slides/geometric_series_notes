# Keynesian Multipliers
Potential problems with model:
* mpc changing 
* no decision making
* savings does not grow the economy 
* makes sense in SR, not LR 


Notation: ! 
* pass through function which can be mutated 


** review code and math, not econ



# Convergence and Uniqueness 
**fixed point theory not examinable 
Dynamic programming **for future reference - poverty traps**
