# missing from equation?
* randomness 

** important **
    transformation out of normal distribution 

E[f(x)] is a dot product of the sum of the vector of f(x)s and all ps

iid - random variables

what are the key assumption on the distribution that make LLN w/ normal distribution possible?
* needs to have a mean

## cauchy distribution
* distribution case where there is no mean
    * long tails (pdf does go to zero but takes a long time)
KEY questions
- how many draws are necessary to get E[f(x)]
    for cauchy, none is enough 

## stochastic processes 
macro inherently dynamic but everything that happened today depends on the time period before (not entirely random)
* therefore, we use stochastic processes
    sequence of random variables (dependence on order)
    * we are using discrete time 
    * but, finance sometimes uses continuous time

## Markov processes 
* unnecessary to know all historical information, only the period before 
    think of a random walk
