# missing from equation?
* randomness 

** important **
    transformation out of normal distribution 

E[f(x)] is a dot product of the sum of the vector of f(x)s and all ps

iid - random variables

what are the key assumption on the distribution that make LLN w/ normal distribution possible?
* needs to have a mean

## cauchy distribution
* distribution case where there is no mean
    * long tails (pdf does go to zero but takes a long time)
KEY questions
- how many draws are necessary to get E[f(x)]
    for cauchy, none is enough 

## stochastic processes 
macro inherently dynamic but everything that happened today depends on the time period before (not entirely random)
* therefore, we use stochastic processes
    sequence of random variables (dependence on order)
    * we are using discrete time 
    * but, finance sometimes uses continuous time

## Markov processes 
* unnecessary to know all historical information, only the period before 
    think of a random walk 
    
## Simple auto-regressive process w/ 1 lag 
* x0 as a value or distribution 
- what is a degenerate random variable? or initial condition?
- how linear combinations of random variables staying normal is relevant for
    future eg?
* dynamics of mean, dynamics of cov
- solve for the formula for the recursion 

## visualizing AR(1) process
* distributions changing over time: var increasing 

- why is f(x_t) = x_t+1 deterministic?
    * x can be a random variable but the distribution is deterministic in the way it evolves


## [code] keyword arguments
* x = iterate_map(x -> f(x; a, b, c), x_0, T) --> binding a,b,c 
    *  same as Python's a=a, b=b, c=c

fun f(x)
    a = x^2
    b = x+2
    return (;a, b) # synonymous to python a=a, b=b

p = (;a=0.9, b=5, e=2)
function f(x,p)
    mu = x[1]
    v = x[2]
    return [p.a * mu + p.b, p.a^2 +v + p.c^2]
end

iterate_map --> f((x; p), ...)

- will x_t+1 = Ax_t + B converge?
    * linear --> prove that there will be a fixed point (if any)

- what is the specral radius 
- what happens when a < 0?


## ergodicity 
- when is something ergodic?

## stochastic productivity 
- constants, what should they be?
    * a < 0 --> stationary (if >0 --> unbounded)
    - possible values for others? outcomes?
* where Z_t = e^zt --> cannot be 0

## ergodicity and capital accumulation

note: we have been doing additive processes

## multiplicative processes 
### for wealth distribution, etc.

## kesten processes 
- why do we need y shock?
* 1 + g < 1 MOST of the time (on average) -- otherwise kesten will blow up
    * 
- page 78, sigma negative same as the function or returns being negative???

x .= a 
* broadcasts the new variable across all of a onto x 
* cna also be written as a for loop
* without the dot: not overwriting x as a 

- why is this different from addititve stochastic processes?
