# Linear difference equations 
when a is less that 1 --> as t goes to infinity, term drops off 
- linear and non-linear difference equations
    * can be reduced to the form: Ly = f where L is some linear operator 
- what is a time homogeneous first order difference equation?
    * time is discrete (think of taking integer values)
    * where h function is at the same at each t: the rule governing the evolution of the state variable remains the same for all periods -- if we apply function h at any time t, we get the next state in the same manner 
    - what is a state space?
    - what is a state variable?
    - what does it mean it is first-order?
        * depends only on one lag (x_t to determine future period and not x_t-1) 

ASK: only doing homogeneous?


## local vs.global stability 
* not the case: converge vs diverge 
    * whereas local: may converge to something else, etc.


Capital defined 
* asset used to make more goods 

# Solow growth model 
* labor supplied inelasticly (non-responsive to incentives - tax benefits, etc - everyone works)
* Kt  is the stock (#)
* diminishing marginal products for BOTH K and N 
- create examples with labor and capital augmenting 
Capital Allocations 
* macroeconomists care about allocation - not money
    * values are in real terms
- question 
    if gN is positive, what happens to kt+1? --> we need to invest more to keep up with the rate of population growth 
introducing choice in the capital allocation formula (moving away from accounting and towards economics)
* Ct +Xt equals the function of Kt and Nt (depends on decisions and trade off)
- question 
    what if s = 1?

## Savings
* formula is non-linear because f(kt) is non-linear 

as fixed point:
    f(k_bar) = k_bar 

# Wages and rental rate of capital
- question
    * what would we need to change in the graph to flatten the savings curve?
- question 
    * firms have to bargaining power over wages - taking them as fixed. This is an assumption of the model. Which other models change this assumption?
- question 
    * when are we sure about the existence of a ss?
    --> strictly concave, delta pos
- question 
    * what happens when gN is 0 or neg? can you get ss?

- EXAM question
    * what extent of plotting is required 

# Code for fixed point steady state 
* H function = right side of Kt+1 equation

## 45 degree diagram for solow 
* type of function plot45?
- what is plot45 doing?
    * mapping k to h(k; p) where p is fixed 

or alternatively ## Transition dynamics 

# Neoclassical model
