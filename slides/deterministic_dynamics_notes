# Linear difference equations 
when a is less that 1 --> as t goes to infinity, term drops off 
## local vs.global stability 
* not the case: converge vs diverge 
    * whereas local: may converge to something else, etc.


Capital defined 
* asset used to make more goods 

# Solow growth model 
* labor supplied inelasticly (non-responsive to incentives - tax benefits, etc - everyone works)
* Kt  is the stock (#)
* diminishing marginal products for BOTH K and N 
- create examples with labor and capital augmenting 

# Neoclassical model
